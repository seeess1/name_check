# name_check
You can use this program to check a list of names in a csv file
to make sure they are the names of people and not the names of
companies or other entities.

In its current form this program is only able to check a csv file that
has one column of full names. Names must either be in first name,
last name order or first, middle, then last name. It cannot check for names
that are ordered last name, then first name.

You will need to have a csv of names you want to check saved as "my_csv.csv"
within the same directory as this file.

The lists of common first and last names were compiled and published by
